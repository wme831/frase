# Frase.io Deals: Rank on Google & AI Search, Save 20% on Annual Plans, 7-Day Free Trial

So here's the thing about content creation in 2026 - everyone's hustling to rank on Google, and now you've got ChatGPT, Perplexity, and all these AI platforms picking winners too. It's like the game changed overnight, and most tools? They're still playing checkers while the world moved to 3D chess.

That's where Frase.io comes in. Not gonna lie, when I first heard about "SEO + GEO optimization," I rolled my eyes. Another buzzword, right? But then I dug in, and honestly, this thing's actually solving a real problem.

## What's Frase.io Actually About?

Picture this: you're trying to write content that ranks. The old way? Open 47 tabs, manually check what's ranking, guess at word counts, pray to the Google gods, hit publish, and... wait three months to see if you screwed up.

Frase basically said "nah" to all that. It's an AI-powered platform that analyzes the top-ranking content for any keyword, tells you exactly what you need to include, and then helps you write it. But here's the kicker - it also optimizes for AI search engines like ChatGPT and Perplexity. Because apparently, people are getting their answers from AI now, not just Google.

The whole platform is built around this idea that you shouldn't have to be a professional SEO wizard to create content that actually performs. You just type in your keyword, and Frase does the detective work.

## The Real Features That Matter

**SEO Research That Doesn't Make You Want to Cry**

You know how competitive analysis usually means opening 20 competitor articles and taking notes like you're back in high school? Frase scrapes the top 20 Google results and gives you everything in one dashboard - word counts, headers they're using, topics they cover, questions people ask. It's like having a really nerdy friend who already did your homework.

**The Content Brief Thing**

Here's where it gets interesting. Frase creates these content briefs that are actually useful. Not like "here are 500 keywords, good luck" but more like "here's the structure that works, here are the subtopics you absolutely need to cover, and here's how deep to go on each one." Your writers (or you) can actually follow this stuff without a PhD in search algorithms.

**AI Writing (With Some Caveats)**

Look, I'm not gonna tell you Frase writes perfect content that needs zero editing. That would be BS. But it does write surprisingly decent drafts that don't sound like a robot had a stroke. You'll still need to add your personality, fact-check, and make it actually interesting. But starting from 60% done beats starting from blank-page-panic.

**GEO Optimization (The Fancy New Thing)**

This is where Frase is actually ahead of the curve. They've got this whole system for optimizing content so AI platforms will cite you. Turns out, ChatGPT and Perplexity look for different signals than Google does - things like content depth, educational quality, clear definitions, data points. Frase scores your content for both traditional SEO and this new GEO stuff. Pretty clever.

**Content Opportunities Dashboard**

This might be my favorite feature because it's proactive instead of reactive. Frase connects to your Google Search Console and automatically finds pages that are underperforming. Then it categorizes them: Fix (broken stuff), Boost (almost ranking), or Fill (content gaps). No more guessing what to work on next.

## Who's Actually Using This?

From what I've seen, three types of people are all-in on Frase:

**Content Marketers** who need to pump out blog posts but also need them to, you know, actually rank. The platform cuts research time way down, which means you can write three posts in the time it used to take to write one.

**Small Marketing Agencies** who are managing content for multiple clients and can't afford to hire a dedicated SEO specialist for each account. Frase basically becomes their SEO brain.

**Solo Bloggers and Small Businesses** who know they need SEO but don't want to become SEO experts. The tool guides you through the process without making you feel stupid.

## The Pricing Situation (Get Your Calculator)

Alright, let's talk money. Frase has three main plans, and I'm gonna break down what you actually get:

| Plan | Monthly Price | Annual Price (Save 20%) | What You Get |
|------|---------------|-------------------------|--------------|
| **Starter** | $49/mo | $39/mo ($468/year) | 1 user, 1 domain, 10 articles/month, basic features |
| **Professional** | $129/mo | $103/mo ($1,236/year) | 3 users, 5 domains, 40 articles/month, content calendar, internal linking |
| **Scale** | $299/mo | $239/mo ($2,868/year) | 5 users, 10 domains, 100 articles/month, auto-linking, advanced features |

**Quick math on the annual deal:** You're saving 20% by paying yearly. For the Professional plan, that's $312 saved. Not nothing.

Here's the deal with "articles per month" - that's how many pieces of content you can create and optimize with Frase. If you go over, you can buy extras at $5 each (Professional) or $4 each (Scale). Honestly not a bad safety net.

**Add-Ons Worth Knowing About:**

- Extra team seats: $29/month each (Professional and Scale plans)
- Pay-as-you-go overages for articles, audit pages, and AI prompts
- API access (Enterprise only)

**The Free Trial Situation:**

Frase offers a 7-day free trial with full access to all features. No credit card required upfront, which is refreshing. You get to actually test the thing before committing. Plus, there's a 7-day money-back guarantee if you do subscribe and hate it.

## Real Talk: What Users Are Actually Saying

I dug through a bunch of reviews because I'm nosy like that, and here's the vibe:

**The Good Stuff People Love:**

"My favorite feature is building article outlines. It allows me to see what ranking articles are doing at a glance and structure our content logically," said one verified G2 reviewer. The outline builder gets praised a lot - people genuinely find it useful for understanding what competitors are doing.

Another user on G2 mentioned: "Before Frase, we could maybe do one post a week. Now we can confidently do three to four a week for each client—and know it's competitive." That productivity boost is a common theme.

Content marketers seem to appreciate that it's not trying to replace them, just make their job easier. As one reviewer put it: "Frase feels like a next-gen content tool that's not just exciting for SEOs, but for writers as well."

**The Complaints (Because Nothing's Perfect):**

Some folks find the UI could be more intuitive. One review mentioned: "It take a little more time to access this tool" and suggested the interface isn't as user-friendly as some competitors.

The AI writing quality gets mixed reviews. Several people noted the content needs significant editing and doesn't perform amazingly in search without human refinement. Fair criticism.

Pricing is a sticking point for some small business owners who feel the monthly cost adds up, especially if you need the add-ons for full functionality.

There are some bitter reviews from lifetime deal customers who feel left behind when Frase rebuilt their platform. That's worth noting if you're thinking long-term.

**The Consensus:**

Most active users seem to think it's worth it *if* you're regularly creating content. If you're posting once a month, probably overkill. But if content is a core part of your strategy, the time savings and ranking improvements justify the cost.

## Promo Codes and Deals (The Treasure Hunt)

Here's what I found digging around for current discounts:

**Annual Billing Discount:** The most reliable deal is simply choosing annual billing - that's an automatic 20% off all plans. On the Professional plan, you'd pay $103/month instead of $129/month. Over a year, that's $312 in savings.

**Referral Program:** Frase has an affiliate/referral system where if you refer customers, they reportedly get deals. Some sources mention codes like "FRASE50" for 50% off the first month, but I couldn't verify if that's currently active.

**Coupon Sites Are Sketchy:** I saw claims of 40%, 60%, even 80% off on various coupon sites, but most of these codes appear to be expired or unverified. The dates on those deals are old - like 2024 or earlier.

**The Real Deal:** Your best bet is the 7-day free trial to test it, then commit to annual billing if you like it. That 20% savings is guaranteed and actually works.

## How It Stacks Up Against Alternatives

People always ask "what about Surfer SEO?" or "isn't ChatGPT free?" So let's address that:

**Frase vs. Surfer SEO:** Surfer is probably the closest competitor. Both do content optimization, but Surfer focuses more on on-page SEO factors while Frase includes the AI-first approach and content opportunities dashboard. Surfer's slightly more expensive with fewer AI writing features. Pick Surfer if you're hardcore about technical SEO; pick Frase if you want a more complete content workflow.

**Frase vs. ChatGPT:** Yeah, ChatGPT can write content for free (or $20/month). But it doesn't do keyword research, competitive analysis, SEO scoring, or GEO optimization. ChatGPT is a writing tool; Frase is a content strategy and optimization platform. They're not really the same thing.

**Frase vs. MarketMuse:** MarketMuse is way more expensive (starts around $149/month) and is more focused on content planning and strategy for enterprises. Frase is more accessible for smaller teams who need to actually create content, not just plan it.

## The Verdict: Is Frase Worth Your Money?

Here's my take after looking at all this:

**You should probably try Frase if:**
- You're creating at least 5-10 pieces of content per month
- You care about SEO but don't want it to be your full-time job
- You're willing to edit AI-generated content rather than write from scratch
- You want to rank on both Google and AI platforms
- You have a content team that needs briefs and structure

**Skip it if:**
- You publish content super rarely (like once a month)
- You're a brilliant writer who loves the blank page
- You're on an extremely tight budget (under $40/month)
- You only care about social media, not search traffic
- You already have a content workflow you love

The platform isn't perfect. The AI writing isn't magical, the UI could be smoother, and the pricing can add up if you need lots of team seats or go over your article limits. But for teams that live and die by organic search traffic, the time savings on research and optimization are legit.

The GEO optimization stuff - getting cited by ChatGPT and Perplexity - that's genuinely forward-thinking. Most SEO tools are still pretending it's 2019. Frase at least acknowledged that the game changed.

## Getting Started (The Actual Steps)

If you want to test Frase without commitment, here's the move:

1. 👉 **[Sign up for the 7-day free trial](https://www.frase.io)** - No credit card required
2. Pick a keyword you actually want to rank for and create a document
3. Check out the content brief and SERP research - see if it saves you time
4. Try writing or optimizing something with the AI tools
5. Look at the Content Opportunities dashboard if you can connect Google Search Console
6. Decide if it's worth $39-$103/month for your situation

If you're going to subscribe, go annual for that 20% discount. That's the smartest financial move.

## Final Thoughts

Look, I'm not gonna tell you Frase.io will revolutionize your life or make you rich overnight. Content marketing is still hard work. But it's a solid tool that genuinely makes the process faster and more data-driven.

The fact that it's optimizing for both traditional search engines and AI platforms means you're somewhat future-proofed as search behavior evolves. And honestly, anything that reduces the number of tabs I need open while researching is a win in my book.

The 7-day trial is legit - use it. Test it with your actual content workflow. See if it clicks for you. Worst case, you spent a week learning something new. Best case, you found a tool that actually saves you 10+ hours a month.

Either way, the content game in 2026 is different than it was last year. Tools that help you adapt? Worth considering.
